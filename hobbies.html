        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Eashah, a passionate designer based in Islamabad. Ever since I can remember, I've been fascinated by aesthetics. I believe that good design is powerful, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and learn new things.
            Aside from design, I have a wide range of interests and hobbies. In my free time, you can often find me reading novels or manga. I believe that these activities not only help me unwind but also inspire creativity and perspective in my work.</p>
